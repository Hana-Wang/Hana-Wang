## Introduction
ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! Iâ€™m Hanna, a recent graduate from a data engineering bootcamp with a strong enthusiasm for turning data into valuable insights. My journey into data engineering has equipped me with the foundational skills to build and manage data pipelines, and Iâ€™m eager to apply what Iâ€™ve learned in real-world projects.

## Skills & Technologies
### During my bootcamp, I gained hands-on experience with:

- Programming Languages: Python(Pandas, Matplotlit, Streamlit, boto3, pg8000, moto, Visual Studio Code), JavaScript, Shell Script
- Data Engineering Tools: FastAPI, AWS, ETL Processes, Data Warehousing, Terraform, Github Actions CI/CD
- Databases: SQL, PostgreSQL
- Cloud Platforms: AWS (S3, EC2, Lambda, Step Functions State Machine), AWS Console, boto3, Terraform
- Data Warehousing: Star Schema
- Version Control: Git, GitHub
- Team Project Work: Agile Methodologies, GitHub, Trello Kanban
- Soft Skills: Problem Solving through hands-on daily mini-project sprints, Communication, Team Collaboration, Patience, Creativity, Organization

### In addition to the above, in my prior education, I had hands-on exprience with:
- Programming Languages: MATLAB, Latex, C++
- Software Engineering: solid four years software engineering education
- Mathematics: Analytical thinking, Problem Solving, Research 

Projects in This Repository
This GitHub repository showcases some of the projects I completed during my bootcamp, including:

- Data Pipeline Project: Basic ETL pipelines demonstrating data extraction, transformation, and loading using tools like Terraform(AWS Lambda, AWS CloudWatch, AWS S3), Python, Boto3, CI/CD, TDD, Agile Methodologies.
- Cloud Data Engineering: Implementations of cloud-based data solutions using AWS services.
- Data Warehouse Dashboard Project: A data app that loads parquet table data from AWS S3 and provides a dashboard for viewing data. The project also includes an upload script for uploading data to S3, an tranfer_data script for transferring table data from PostgreSQL to tables in the formats including parquet, csv and json.

## My Learning Approach
- I am continuously learning and refining my skills, and I approach every project as an opportunity to grow.
- I value collaboration, clear communication, and am committed to writing clean, efficient code.
- While Iâ€™m just starting out in the field, Iâ€™m passionate about data engineering and eager to contribute to meaningful projects.
- While I am particularly interested in Data Engineering roles, I am also open to exploring positions in software engineering, machine learning, or data analysis. My focus is on finding a technical role where I can collaborate with a team, apply my skills to real-world challenges, and grow alongside experienced professionals.

## Contact Me
Iâ€™m currently seeking entry-level opportunities where I can further develop my skills and contribute to a team.
